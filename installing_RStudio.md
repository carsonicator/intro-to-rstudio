# Step 1: Download and install R

1.  Go to the [Comprehensive R Archive Network(CRAN)](http://ftp.osuosl.org/pub/cran/).
2.  Pick the appropriate version for your computer:
    * **PC**: Pick the base version.
    * **Linux**: Choose the correct distribution and follow the instructions.
    * **Macs**:
      * `R-3.2.1.pkg` (Snow Leopard)
      * `R-3.3.3.pkg` (Mavericks)
      * `R-3.6.1.pkg` (El Capitan and higher)

        Make sure to read the notes on the install page:

        > R 3.6.1 binary for OS X 10.11 (El Capitan) and higher, signed package. Contains R 3.6.1 framework, R.app GUI 1.70 in 64-bit for Intel Macs, Tcl/Tk 8.6.6 X11 libraries and Texinfo 5.2. The latter two components are optional and can be ommitted when choosing "custom install", they are only needed if you want to use the tcltk R package or build package documentation from sources.
        >
        > Note: the use of X11 (including tcltk) requires XQuartz to be installed since it is no longer part of OS X. Always re-install XQuartz when upgrading your macOS to a new major version.
        >
        > Important: this release uses Clang 7.0.0 and GNU Fortran 6.1, neither of which is supplied by Apple. If you wish to compile R packages from sources, you will need to download and install those tools - see the tools directory.

3.	After download, install R with default settings.
